\section{Summary}

Hi! I'm Tate. Human being, professional software developer since more than 10 years and... yes, I love doing this.
Deeply rejector of -not my job- way of "thinking".\\

After so many years, high performance, easy maintenance, tidy and scalable solutions becomes an obsession.
Meet requirements is a must, but things do not end there... code should take in consideration short and long term future.
For instance, new business rules. And, is in that moment, were good design comes into play.\\

When using a high level programming language, code is written for humans, not computers, there is no reason to don't focus on high readability.
\textbf{Agile methodologies can respond to changes, we need also to write code able to respond to changes.}\\

I value transparency, positive and proactive attitude. Healthy teams were everyone trust on each other work and capabilities.\\

Nice to meet you.\\
