## Summary
Hi, I'm Tate, a software developer with more than 10 years of experience wich loves his work.
I'm that kind of dev who values high performance, easy maintenance, tidy and scalable solutions.
I'm convinced about cheap code is not a good invest and I don't feel comfortable working on teams were phrases like "is not a
good solution but it works", "not my job" or "it works on my local" are frequent during the workday.

It is important to meet requiriments, actually a must, but also desing and code must consider short and long term future.
As example, possible changes on the business rules. And that's when easy maintenance and scalability comes into play.
When using a high level programming language code is written for humans, not computers, so high readability is a must too.
Agile methodologies respond to changes, we also need to write code able to respond to changes.
I've vast experience working in Agile projects, being part of near-shore teams.
I make focus on valuable software, looking to accomplish client requirements and deadlines as a top priority.

I think myself as a strongly results oriented developer, I love to face challenges, solve problems, discuss ideas, implementations and learn something new every day.
A positive and proactive attitude is crucial, specially when leading interdisciplinary teams and of course,
caring about interpersonal relationships.
Team work is critical, as a team member I always keep in mind I'm being part of one, when writing code, using a repo,
asking for help, helping someone, managing tickets, consuming shared resources or any other task involved on my daily work.
When every team member pushes in the same direction things gets done faster and better.

Let's build something amazing!
