## Summary
Hi! I'm Tate. Human being. Computer hobbyist since age 6 and professional software engineer since more
han 12 years. Quality is an obsession for me. Quality means (plus "it works"), high performance, smart
design, tidy, scalable, organic, easy to maintain, easy to understand, quick for writing and... easy
to delete.

Soon or later, business rules on a project can change, and is in that moment, were good design comes
into play. I mean, meet requirements is a must, but things do not end there... code must handle short
and long term future.

When using a high level programming language or a framework, code is written for humans, not computers.
There is no reason to avoid high readability or don't speed up development process using framework
capabilities. **_Agile methodologies can respond to changes but, we must write code able to respond to
changes._**

I value transparency, positive and proactive attitude, healthy teams were everyone can trust on each
other.

Nice to meet you.
_Let's build something amazing!_
