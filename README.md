## Summary
Hi! I'm Tate. Human being. Computer hobbyist since age 6 and professional software engineer since more
han 12 years. Quality is top priority for me. Quality means (plus "it works"), high performance, smart
design, tidy, scalable, organic, testeable, easy to maintain, easy to understand, fast writing, easy
to deploy and... easy to delete code.

Soon or later, business rules on a project can change, and is in that moment, were good design comes
into play. I mean, meet requirements is a must, but things do not end there... code must handle short
and long term future.

When using a high level programming language or a framework, code is written for humans, not computers.
There is no reason to avoid high readability or don't speed up development process using framework
capabilities. **_Agile methodologies can respond to changes but, we must write code able to respond to
changes._**

I value transparency, proactive attitude and healthy teams were everyone can trust on each others skills.

Nice to meet you.
_Let's build something amazing!_
