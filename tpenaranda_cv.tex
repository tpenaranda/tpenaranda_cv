\section{Summary}

Hi! I’m Tate. Human being. Computer hobbyist since age 6 and professional software engineer since more than 12 years.
Quality is an obsession for me. Quality means (plus "it works"), high performance, smart design, tidy, scalable, organic, testeable, easy to maintain, easy to understand, fast writing and... easy to delete code.\\


Soon or later, business rules on a project will change, and is in that moment, when smart design comes into play.
Meet requirements is a must, but things do not end there... code must handle short and long term future.\\

When using a high level programming language or a framework, code is written for humans, not computers. There is no reason to avoid high readability or not speed up development process using framework capabilities.
\textbf{Agile methodologies work well under unexpected changes but, we must also write code able to respond to changes.}\\

I value transparency, positive and proactive attitude, healthy teams were everyone can trust on each other.\\

Nice to meet you.\\
\textit{Let's build something amazing!}\\

\medskip The technologies I've been using during the latest months include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Laravel 5, Vue.js, React Native, PWA, Workbox, DigitalOcean, Heroku, BCoin SPV/Full Node
  \item Shopify, Swagger, Elasticsearch, Composer, Redis, MySQL, Travis CI, PHPUnit, Linux, Figure Eight, Amazon Machine Turk
  \item HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, TDD, Git, Responsive Design, Scrum, Agile
\end{itemize}

    \\I had the chance to plan, design and write the very first line of code for the app. Being the only dev on a low budget project forced me to handle FE, BE, infrastructure and blockchain integration. It was my first interaction with bitcoin node but dev process was smooth and fast, after a few weeks MVP was live, including users wallets, transactions and external integrations (Shopify, Workato, Postmark).\\
